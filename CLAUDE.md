# Roomshare — Claude Code Project Rules

All project-specific operating rules, guidelines, and conventions live in:

**[`.claude/CLAUDE.md`](.claude/CLAUDE.md)**

That file contains: mission priorities, non-negotiables, agent operating rules,
architecture boundaries, reliability/security rules, testing rules, code style,
DB/migration safety, and the PR/delivery checklist.
