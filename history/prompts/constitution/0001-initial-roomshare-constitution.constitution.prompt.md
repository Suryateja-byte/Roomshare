## Prompt

/sp.constitution

## Response snapshot

Created Roomshare constitution v1.0.0 with 6 core principles derived from existing project rules: (I) Correctness & Abuse-Resistance, (II) Privacy & Security, (III) User Experience, (IV) Cost Efficiency, (V) Testing Discipline, (VI) Maintainability & Simplicity. Added Architecture Boundaries, Database & Migration Safety, and Governance sections. All templates verified for alignment.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established foundational governance document for all Roomshare development
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (documentation artifact)
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md (created)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.specify to define a feature, or refine constitution principles
- 🧠 Reflection: Principles derived from existing .claude/CLAUDE.md project rules to ensure consistency
