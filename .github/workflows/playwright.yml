# =============================================================================
# Playwright E2E Tests — Sharded for Speed
# =============================================================================
# Splits tests across 4 parallel runners, then merges results into one report.
#
# How sharding works:
#   Playwright's --shard=X/Y flag divides the full test file list into Y equal
#   buckets and only runs bucket X. Each shard gets its own PostGIS database,
#   dev server, and Chromium instance — fully isolated.
#
# How report merging works:
#   Each shard uses --reporter=blob which outputs a binary blob to blob-report/.
#   The merge-reports job downloads all 4 blobs, then runs
#   `playwright merge-reports` to combine them into a single HTML report
#   (with all test results, traces, screenshots) uploaded as a GitHub Artifact.
