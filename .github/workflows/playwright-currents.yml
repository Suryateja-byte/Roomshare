# =============================================================================
# Playwright E2E Tests — Currents Orchestration (20 shards)
# =============================================================================
# Uses Currents pwc-p orchestration to dynamically distribute test files
# across 20 parallel GitHub Actions runners. Unlike native --shard which
# splits files lexically, orchestration uses a real-time task queue that
# balances work based on historical test duration data — up to 40% faster.
#
# How it works:
#   1. All 20 runners share the same CURRENTS_CI_BUILD_ID
#   2. Each runner connects to the Currents orchestration server
#   3. The server dynamically assigns test files to runners as they become free
#   4. Auth setup runs first (pwc-p doesn't support project dependencies)
#   5. Results stream to the Currents dashboard in real-time
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - CURRENTS_RECORD_KEY must be set as a GitHub repository secret
#   - Currents project ID: zz7AZ8
